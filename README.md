# ThoriumOS
This is still work in progress. Nothing will work right now.

A simple OS written in C and Assembly (like every other OS).

## How to Run:
### Linux:
Run `make` and then `./run.sh`.

### MacOS:
Probably the same as on Linux.

### Windows:
Absolutely no idea. Maybe it works in WSL?

### Real Hardware:
What are you doing.
