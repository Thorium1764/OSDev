# ThoriumOS
This is still work in progress. Nothing will work right now.

A simple OS written in C and Assembly (like every other OS).

## How to Run:
### Linux:
Run `make.sh` and run it in Qemu or another VM of your choice.

### MacOS:
Probably the same as on Linux.

### Windows:
Absolutely no idea.

### Real Hardware:
What are you doing.
